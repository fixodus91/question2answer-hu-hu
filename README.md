## Updates, contributing

It's not likely that we'd do frequent updates, but if we do a round of fixes I'll make it sure to update this repo as well.

If you find some mistakes in the translations I appreciate if you send a pull request for them.

## Thanks

- To the [Question2Answer project](https://www.question2answer.org/) for writing this great piece of software.
- To my company [CodeBerry](https://codeberryschool.com) that did the translations and wanted to give back to the community by sharing it.
